ADDITIONAL NOTES: I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THIS AS A WORKING PROTOTYPE FOR THE GAME. MY MAIN FOCUS THIS PROJECT WAS DEVELOPING AN ENGINE WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE IDEAL WAY TO DESIGN PROJECTS GOING FORWARD AS IT ALLOWS FOR MORE TIME DEVELOPING CONTENT RATHER THAN BUG HUNTING. THOUGH THE ENGINE IS BASIC, I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW IT TURNED OUT AND WITH WHAT IT ALLOWS ME TO DO. I ALSO HAD FUN DEVELOPING A LOT OF MY OWN SOUNDFX, MUSIC, AND DOING ALL THE GRAPHICS FOR THE GAME. I KNOW WE'RE NOT GRADED ON THOSE ELEMENTS, BUT IN REFLECTION OF THE PROJECT I WANTED TO AT LEAST NOTE THEM WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS PROJECT YEARS FROM NOW. THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT, PIPPIN :)
