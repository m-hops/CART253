ARTIST STATEMENT:

I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THIS AS A WORKING PROTOTYPE FOR THE GAME (THE ENDING, FOR EXAMPLE, JUST LOOPS BACK TO THE BEGINNING BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE IN THE FINAL PRODUCT). MY MAIN FOCUS WITH THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS DEVELOPING AN ENGINE WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE IDEAL WAY TO DESIGN PROJECTS GOING FORWARD AS IT ALLOWS FOR MORE TIME DEVELOPING CONTENT RATHER THAN BUG HUNTING. THOUGH THE ENGINE IS BASIC, I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW IT TURNED OUT AND WITH WHAT IT ALLOWS ME TO DO, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO IMPLEMENTING JUMP SCARES AT RANDOM IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. THE ONE THING I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO DO WAS DEVELOP A BETTER ANIMATION PORTION OF THE ENGINE AS PROGRAMMING THE FINAL KIND OF JUMP SCARE TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO MAKE. I ALSO HAD FUN DEVELOPING A LOT OF MY OWN SOUNDFX, MUSIC, AND DOING ALL THE GRAPHICS FOR THE GAME. I KNOW WE'RE NOT GRADED ON THOSE ELEMENTS, BUT IN REFLECTION OF THE PROJECT I WANTED TO AT LEAST NOTE THEM WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS PROJECT YEARS FROM NOW.

ORIGINALLY, I HAD PLANNED TO HAVE A LOT MORE FEATURES SUCH AS THE END GAME WHERE THERE WOULD BE A SERIES OF REFLEX AND TIME BASED MINI-GAMES AKIN TO WARIOWARE, BUT AFTER DOING A GAME JAM AND SEEING HOW MUCH WORK WOULD GO INTO MAKING A MULTITUDE OF THOSE GAMES, I DECIDED TO PUSH THOSE FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD IN PRODUCTION. MAYBE THEY'LL BE WHAT I BUILD NEXT IN THE ENGINE.

THOUGH IN IT'S CURRENT STATE THE GAME LACKS MUCH OF A NARRATIVE, I AM ABOUT 25% THROUGH WRITING THE SCRIPT FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT. THE CHALLENGE IN THIS IS THAT I'M USED TO WRITING SCRIPTS FOR PLAYS OR FILM, SO ADDING IN THE ELEMENT OF USER INTERACTIVITY AND ANTICIPATING THAT HAS OFFERED A CHALLENGING BUT FUN OBSTACLE. DURING THE WINTER BREAK, IT IS MY GOAL TO READ BOTH SILENT HILL THE TERROR ENGINE AND HORROR VIDEO GAMES BY NERNARD PERRON TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO IMPLEMENT AN FUN AND UPSETTING HORROR GAME THAT FEATURES QUEER THEMES AS I FIND THOSE AT BEST, LACKING IN MODERN MEDIA.

MY HOPE IS IN TIME, I CAN DEVELOP THE LESSOR KEY TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL: A POINT AND CLICK ADVENTURE THAT CREATES A SENSE OF DISCOMFORT WITH A JARRING STORY.

FUTURE BUILD TO DO:

-IMPLEMENT NOTE BOOK
-IMPLEMENT ENDING MINI GAME
-IMPLEMENT MORE NARRATIVE ELEMENTS
-IMPLEMENT INVENTORY SYSTEM
-FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER IMPLEMENT ANIMATIONS
