ADDITIONAL NOTES:
                IN THE FUTURE, IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO STORE MORE IMAGE DATA INSIDE GLOBAL VARIABLES TO MAINTAIN CLEANER CODE. HOWEVER, IT WOULD ALSO BE LIKELY THAT I WOULD CREATE EXTERNAL IMAGES AND IMPORT THEM INSTEAD, THUS CUTTING DOWN ON THE EXTRA CODE.

                ALSO, DUE TO AUTOPLAY LIMITATIONS IN CHROME, AUDIO PORTION WILL ONLY WORK IN FIREFOX. APPARENTLY THERE IS A WAY AROUND THE CHROME BLOCK, BUT AS OF THIS ASSIGNMENT, I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE AN ACCEPTABLE METHOD.
