ADDITIONAL NOTES:

                  ON TOP OF WHAT WAS ASSIGNED THIS WEEK, I WANTED TO PUSH MY LEARNING TO INCLUDE HITBOXS AS WELL AS ROTATION OF MOVING OBJECTS WHILST STILL KEEPING THEM      CONSISTENT. IT WAS DURING THIS ASSIGNMENT I REALLY LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE-PLANNING AND SETTING UP GLOBAL VARIABLES BEFORE STARTING WORK. GOING FORWARD I'LL BE MAKING SURE TO PLAN THIS BETTER ON PAPER. THINGS I WISH I COULD ADD WOULD BE A WAY TO LOOP BACK TO THE HOME SCREEN ONCE THE GAME IS OVER, SWINGING LIGHTS TO MAKE VISIBILITY HARDER, AND POSSIBLY MOVEMENT ANIMATIONS DURING THE STATIC SCREENS.
