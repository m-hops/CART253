# FFAR 250 - EXERCISE 4: AGE OF AQUARIUMS - 10/20/2020

CREATOR:          MADELINE ZAYTSOFF

DESCRIPTION:      CREATE AQUARIUM LIKE SIMULATION WHILE DISPLAYING EXAMPLES OF:
                  1. ADDITION OF ONE USER CONTROLLED SHAPE OR IMAGE
                  2. A USER INTERACTION INVOLVING THE "FISH"
                  3. ALTERATION OF FISH TO SOMETHING MORE THAN A BASIC CIRCLE
                  4. AT LEAST 2 ENDINGS

RESOURCES:        N/A

ADDITIONAL NOTES: THIS PROJECT IS LESS IMAGE HEAVY THAN MAYBE SOME OF MY PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS AND THAT'S ON PURPOSE.
                  I WANTED TO FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING ARRAY FLOWS AND HIBOX DETECTION ON THE BACK END RATHER THAN MAKING
                  A MORE COMPELLING VISUAL PRESENTATION.
                  THE HITBOX DETECTION FORMULA IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH AND PROUD OF.
