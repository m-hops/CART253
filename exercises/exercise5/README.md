# FFAR 250 - EXERCISE 5: JUGGLE GARDEN - 10/24/2020

CREATOR:          MADELINE ZAYTSOFF

DESCRIPTION:      CREATE A JUGGLING SIMULATOR WITH THE FOLLOWING:
                  1. ADD ONE FORM OF USER-CONTROL
                  2. ADD AT LEAST ONE NEW CLASS AND OBJECTS
                  3. ADD AT LEAST TWO ENDINGS

RESOURCES:        N/A

ADDITIONAL NOTES: MUCH MORE UTILITARIAN THEN I'D LIKE, BUT I DID ENJOY FIGURING OUT A FORMULA THAT CREATED ROWS OF TILES USING ARRAYS.
